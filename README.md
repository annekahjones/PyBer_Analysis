# PyBer_Analysis
Ridesharing app data visualization project 
## Overview
We are performing this analysis to see how ride-sharing differs between the different types of cities. By splitting our data into three different city types: rural, suburban, and urban, we are able to get a better idea of the popularity of each area, how many drivers there are, and what the fares look like for each area and/or specific drive. This data is then split up even further by date so we can see which months outperform others and if there are any days or weeks that stand out in certain areas. 

## Results
From the DataFrames that were created, we can see that there is definitely a different between the different city types. In the rural areas, there were less of every category; rides, drivers, fares, etc. However, there were still a decent amount of rides with a small amount of drivers to where the drivers were abel to profit nicely off of the rides. In the suburban areas, we see that the number of rides increased dramatically, but the number of drivers did not inrease at the same rate. Therefore, the averages per ride and per driver for the fares stayed relatively high. In the urban areas, we see that the number of drivers increase about 30 times from that of rural areas, but the number of rides increased by only about 13 times from rural areas. The average fares decreased for both per ride and per driver.

## Summary
### First
I would recommend limiting the number of drivers in the urban areas to increase the average fares for the drivers. There is an oversaturation in this area that is most likely only going to grow. 
### Second 
I would advise to increase the recruitment of drivers at the end of February/beginning of March since there seems to be a bit of a spike across the board from all city types in the fares, which most likely means this is an increase in business. The more people that are working during this time, the better. 
### Lastly 
I would say that there is not really a time of year where one type of city is going to outperform another. The trends seem to be pretty strongly set and as long as nothing disrupts the flow of business, the areas seem to be operating fairly consistently week by week, at least at this time of the year.
